# My Royal Ship
Ever wanted your own ship for others to gauze at, do you ever look at that black and white shuttle and wonder "I want that" Well, This is the mod for you! Introducing My Royal Shuttle, a mod that let's use your own shuttle! All for the low price of being a noble! Get yours today!

[h1] How do I Obtain the Shuttle?[/h1]
  - Have an Colonist gain the rank of knight in Royalty
  - After that, you'll get a techprint and your Shuttle 
 
[h1] Does this inpact the vanilla shuttle in anyway? [/h1]
  - No, Everything in this mod is seperated from the vanilla shuttle except for the textures
  
 [h2] Known Bugs and Glitches [/h2]
  - The Shuttle on the map screen is compressed and is upside down
  - The Shuttle given to you may land in your building, destroying all the walls and furniture
    - Simple fix is having your drop pod spot away from any buildings, either with the mod or with beacons (Drop pods always drop closest to the beacons)
    
[h2] Thanks and Credits [/h2]

- Ludeon for making the shuttle textures
- Smashphil and Necero's for making Srts, which is the basis for this mod.
